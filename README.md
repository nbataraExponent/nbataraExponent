## Nicolas Batara, PhD at Exponent Inc.

I'm a multidiciplinary computer expert (hardware and software). I consult on projects across numerous industries where I gather and synthesize stakeholder and user needs to perform development and analysis of digital and analog electronic systems.

In addition, I have served also an expert witness on matters related to software.
